# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- `molla.sys.mmap`, a read only whole file memory map
- `molla.model.gguf`, a GGUF v2 and v3 metadata reader that walks the header, the key value block and the tensor directory in place without copying the file, and `molla gguf <path>` to dump one
- `docs/validation/gguf.md` with the comparison against `gguf-dump` on four models covering bert, llama, gemma3 and qwen2, and what the zero copy read is actually worth

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-31

First tagged release. Three of the seven M0 spikes are done: the toolchain is pinned across the fleet, sockets and the event loop work on epoll and kqueue, and HTTP/1.1 parse and respond clears the throughput gate. Nothing serves a model yet.

### Added

- Pixi workspace with the Mojo toolchain pinned to 1.0.0, locked for macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64
- A `molla` binary with `version` and `help`, reporting the toolchain and detected host
- A test runner, since Mojo 1.0 has no `mojo test`
- CI builds and tests on all three platforms for real, and smoke tests the binary
- `docs/validation/toolchain.md` recording the pin, the machines validated so far, and what Mojo 1.0 actually looks like against the release notes
- `molla.sys`, the libc boundary: errno, descriptors, IPv4 TCP sockets, and one `Poller` over kqueue and epoll with read and write interest
- `molla.net.echo`, a non blocking edge triggered TCP echo server, and `molla echo` to run it
- `molla soak`, which holds a thousand connections for sixty seconds and checks for descriptor and memory leaks
- `docs/validation/sockets.md` with the soak results on all three platforms and what the spike says about D1
- `molla.http`, a zero copy HTTP/1.1 request parser and a prebuilt response with an in place `Date` field, and `molla http` to run the throughput spike
- `docs/validation/http.md` with the M0 throughput measurements, the fleet results, and the two allocation and socket problems that cost more than the parser did
- Design document, roadmap, and milestone plan
- CI with docs linting, workflow linting, CodeQL on workflow definitions, OpenSSF Scorecard, and dependency review
- Release pipeline with SBOM, build provenance attestation, and keyless signing
- `scripts/check-action-pins.sh`, run in CI, which fails if an action is pinned to an annotated tag object rather than a commit

### Changed

- The toolchain version lives only in `pixi.toml` now, rather than also in a CI environment variable

### Fixed

- Six actions were pinned to annotated tag object SHAs instead of commit SHAs, which made the OpenSSF Scorecard workflow fail on publish with an imposter commit error even though the scan itself succeeded

### Known issues

- The Mojo compiler we build with comes from Modular's conda channel under a proprietary license, so the build is not yet Apache-2.0 end to end even though the source is. See `docs/design.md`.
- Releases are source only for the same reason. A Mojo 1.0 binary links `libKGENCompilerRTShared` and two other runtime libraries that ship only as shared objects under `LicenseRef-Modular-Proprietary`, and the linker bakes RUNPATH to the pixi directory that built it, so a bare binary does not start anywhere else. Publishing a working tarball would mean redistributing Modular's runtime inside molla's own artifacts. Build with `pixi run build` until that changes.

molla answers HTTP requests as of the M0 spike, but every path returns the same fixed body. The first milestone that serves a model is M2.
